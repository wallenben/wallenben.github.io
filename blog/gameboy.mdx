Recently, I have started work on a Gameboy (DMG-101) emulator to get a better understanding of system architecture and the process of software emulation. It's reasonable to assume this is the most difficult project I have taken on, but is easily one of my favorite projects I have ever worked on!  

Because I am giving a talk on this project at UW - Madison, I intend to document a fair portion of my development lifecycle for posterity, and hopefully to incentivize more emulation development in the future.
