***Design choices in emulation***  
One of the biggest hurdles I faced early on was the quientessential design decision of what language to use for this emulator project. Initially, I figured writing the emulator in C would be ideal - I could use a graphics library like [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) to display the emulator effectively,  but after initial testing it was very apparent that the lack of the std library from C++ would add another layer of "research abstraction": I would be researching the GB archietecture, SDL, and C itself -- which is a bit too much for me to tackle in one project.

Because C was out of the question, my natural inclination was to check out C++ - most of the fun of C with nice enhancements to streamline development. While I think C++ would be a fine choice for emulation development, I ended up deciding to use JavaScript (TypeScript) instead to take advantage of various nicities of JS. 

 - Graphics are very easy to display with JS and `<canvas>` tags 
 - JSON is a godsend for various architectural complexities e.g. registers and flags in the CPU  
 - I would like to become more familar with JS for web development purposes
