title: New Website Design
date: 6/9/22

My personal website isn't bad, but it's nothing spectacular. The UI is servicable, but not nearly as intuitive as design layouts prevalent on many major websites. Functionally, using tailwind and Gatsby was an excellent choice for a static personal website, but I would like to explore how I can truly push modern browsing to the limit (using popular libraries like three.js for 3D rendering). As such, I have decided to build a new website, using SvelteKit and Chakra UI to research further into this.

Indeed, this can't be the chief focus, unfortunately. With the early tech market in moderate decline, it is more imperative than ever to have an excellent background in various LeetCode-esque questions, to be prepared for industry interviews. Sadly this will have to take focus in the interim. While it isn't the most fun work - it must be done to 'stay ahead of the pack' and get the cool interviews.
